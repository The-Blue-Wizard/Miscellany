# Old experimental idea...

Years ago (more than 15 years ago!) I was kicking around with the idea
of implementing what I would call a (lightweight) transactional
execution (or transactional processing) for C language, and I wrote
up what amounted to a combination of an essay and a description
document for what I had in mind for it, along with a prototyping
language used to develop that idea. It is rather unfinished, but one
can run the Python script on test files to see how it might work.

Note: Use `unittesting.py` program to play with `testN.tc` files;
do not run `transact.py` (as the `__main__` code portion is totally
unfinished) or `unittestsample.py` (as I once tried to use UnitTest
framework, starting with a sample Python code I grabbed, but quickly
gave up on it after getting bogged down reading the document
:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:)

The [transact.md](transact.md) is a Markdown edition of `transact.txt`,
cleaned up a bit for modern reading. Enjoy! Feel free to comment,
"steal" the idea, whatever. But I would love to hear some feedbacks
about my idea.
