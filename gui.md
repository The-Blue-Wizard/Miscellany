# A GUI system (for Kestrel computers, and for others, perhaps...)

This is the very first draft.

Right now I am just listing a grab bag of various
ideas, and everyone is invited to contribute, comment, etc.

OK, the GUI system should be modular, lightweight, responsive

## Some GUIs we like...

What kc5tja likes:

* OS/2 2.0
* Amiga 2.04
* Win 95
* GEM 1.0 (with a bit of updates)

What TheBlueWizard likes:

* Amiga 2.04
* Win 95

## Desirable traits of GUI:

GUI should be customizable (something similar to MUI). The event flow as found in web browsers'
Document Object Model (DOM) should be emulated (sorear). kc5tja notes that the configurability
in GEM would be done by replacing AES.

TheBlueWizard likes the idea of layers (X Windows, win manager, etc.)

GUI should have internal communication protocol, like one widget get updated from
another widget, etc.
